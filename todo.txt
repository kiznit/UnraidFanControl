Branding - remove "Unraid" from title (?) and add some flavour (kzinti? kz? Thierry?)


Hard Drive Temp
    - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/lm_sensors
    - See section 5.3 - S.M.A.R.T. drive temperature

    Since kernel 5.6 the drivetemp module will report SATA/SAS temperature through hwmon, but sensors-detect does not automatically detect this so the module must be manually loaded.

    # modprobe drivetemp


Calling "sensors" will spin-up drives, which is not what we want. Here is a script that checks disks.ini for temp info:
